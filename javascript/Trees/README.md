CC 16:
Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

Write the following method for the Binary Tree class

find maximum value
Arguments: none
Returns: number
Find the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

CC 17:
Breadth-first Traversal.

Write a function called breadth first
Arguments: tree
Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered

CC 18:
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a k-ary (used Binary per Ryan's permission) tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.

Set the values of each of the new nodes depending on the corresponding node value in the source tree.

Write a function called fizz buzz tree
Arguments: k-ary tree
Return: new k-ary tree
Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
